Quick April Fools joke I made. Just made a batch file that runs this, made a shortcut to that and changed icon.

* Create a batch file in your C drive and put this in it: java -jar "C:\AprilFools.jar
* Build the project on your computer, and put the jar file in your C drive.
* Right click batch file, send to -> desktop.
* Right click your new icon, go to properties, change icon, and pick whatever. (I did internet explorer, and told the person being pranked to go look up an article :P)
